\chapter{Preface}

These lecture notes are intended for PDV course at the Czech Technical University, but could perhaps be of more widespread interest. 

\section*{About the authors}

Jakub Marecek first taught a course on ``Advanced C++ Programming'' in 1999 in Brno, the Czech Republic. Since then, he has worked at the University of Nottingham, ARM Ltd., the University of Edinburgh, IBM Research, and the University of California, Los Angeles.

A wider team has contributed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simon Toth has been a major source of inspiration for the project with his book The Standard Algorithms in C++. The build system for the lecture notes is taken from the book almost in verbatim, in compliance with the Creative Commons licence. The lecture notes also feature several examples from his book. 
\item Illia Kryvoviaz has fixed numerous issues with the examples and added the GodBolt links. 
\item Jan Mrkos has provided a number of suggestions that improved the SYCL chapter in particular. 
\end{itemize}
