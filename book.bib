	abstract = {We present in this paper a formal generic framework, implemented in the Coq proof assistant, for defining and reasoning about weak memory models. We first present the three axioms of our framework, with several examples as illustration and justification. Then we show how to implement several existing weak memory models in our framework, and prove formally that our implementation is equivalent to the native definition for each of these models.},
